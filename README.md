The GPuzzle Project
----------

The GPuzzle project aims to create a simple, educational-purposed program
to demonstrate the process of recreating the human geno sequence from segments
of said sequence.

The program is written in Processing 2 / Java.

Target
----------

The GPuzzle project aims to demonstrate the power of proper use of data structures
and algorithms, and how such use can dramatically effect the performance of the
program. The program aims to solve comparingly smaller sequences, and are designed to
be able to read input from different sources (File system / Database / Network etc.)

Current goal is to be able to effectively recreate the sequence of about ten thousand
bases with segments about one hundred bases in size.

####Goals

these goals are based on a randomly generated sequence

1. 80% Rate of getting the original sequence correctly
2. Be able to run the program within a resaonable amount of time (24 Hours?)
3. Be able to run the program on commercial PCs (i5 3rd Gen. + 6GB Memory?)
